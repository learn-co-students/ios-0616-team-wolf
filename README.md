# WanderSpark
*Feed your wanderlust with a compatibility tool that matches you to your next vacation destination.*

WanderSpark matches users to vacation destinations by discovering their travel preferences and returning locations that are consistent with these preferences. Users are first presented with a series of cards that visually represent destination traits ranging from beaches and mountains to shopping and nightlife. For each card, users swipe left or right to indicate whether they prefer this trait. After collecting all of the user’s responses, results are tallied and locations that best match the user’s preferences are returned along with flight information.
